# CHG-2-001 Generalise measurement service

## Status

 Accepted

## Context

A new type of measurement is being accepted by the service and in the future it is expected that other weather measurement types will need to be accepted.  The design of the service needs to be changed to allow additional types of measurements to be accepted with lower effort.

It is also recognized that different devices are likely to support more than one measure, so the design should accommodate this likely future requirement.

## Decision

The decision has been made to *generalise* the measurement service so that it will be able to accept measurements of different types.

## Consequences

As a consequence of this change it will be easier to add new types of measurements in the future. 

The existing measurement service will need to be supported until all clients are transitioned off of the RainfallMeasurement service.
